Starter project code for students taking Udacity ud120

## Notes

## Classifiers

* Naive Bayes
* SVM (SVC - C = Classifier)
* Decision Tree
  * Ensemble methods
    * Adaboost
    * Random Forest

# Lesson 6: Datasets and Questions
More Data > Fine Tuned Algorithm
Data Types
 * Numerical (discrete or continuous?)
 * Categories/Enums
 * Time series (date/time stamp)
 * text
 
# Lesson 7: Regressions + Continuous Supervised Learning
 * Continuous meaning a continuous output range, not continuously learning
 * Continuous vs. Discrete
 
 Result is often just a simple line fit (y = mx + b)
 
 reg.predict takes an array
 reg.coef_ & reg.intercept_
 reg.score provides r**2

Classification vs. Regression
Discrete vs. Continuous
Decision Boundary vs. Best Fit Line
Accuracy vs. Sum of Squares/R^2 to determine accuracy
